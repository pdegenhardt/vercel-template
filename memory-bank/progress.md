## Known Issues

2. Some form submissions may need additional validation in a production environment.
3. Authentication is configured but will need real provider credentials for production use.
4. Setup process requires manual entry of OAuth credentials which could be streamlined further.

## Next Focus Areas

1. Add additional documentation for components
2. Improve accessibility features
3. Optimize for performance with large datasets
4. Enhance setup process with validation and better guidance
5. Create documentation for the setup process
